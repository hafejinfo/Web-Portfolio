            The story here wasnâ€™t terrible, but I just feel that with 12 episodes at their disposal, the brains behind My Dream could have given us a bit more. Next, although some parts of the fantasy story line were fleshed out (albeit not nearly enough), the main story between Runway and Dream.

                The T-shaped model is a concept that has been around for a while that describes the abilities or characteristics of an individual. An ideal T-shaped person has many generalized skills with a specialization in one or a few specific fields.A full-stack web developer is an excellent example of this model as the developer has general knowledge across a wide breadth of technologies and platforms as well as in-depth experience and specialization in a couple of those concepts.
